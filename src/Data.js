  story: "My name is Sharyar Khan. I am from Attock city, Pakistan, and my journey in technology began with my studies in electrical associate engineering. I later pursued my degree in computer science from Arid University, graduating in 2023. I started my career as a web developer, completing several projects using Django, Express, and React. After gaining experience in web development, I transitioned into the field of AI. Now, I specialize in Agentic AI and explore cutting-edge technologies like PyTorch, scikit-learn, LangChain, and OpenAI SDK. I am also passionate about robotics, Python programming, and leveraging frameworks such as CrewAI and AutoGen to create intelligent, adaptive systems."
